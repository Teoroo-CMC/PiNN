title = {Machine learning inference of molecular dipole moment in liquid water},
journal = {Mach. learn.: sci. technol.},
abstract = {Molecular dipole moment in liquid water is an intriguing property, partly due to the fact that there is no unique way to partition the total electron density into individual molecular contributions. The prevailing method to circumvent this problem is to use maximally localized Wannier functions, which perform a unitary transformation of the occupied molecular orbitals by minimizing the spread function of Boys. Here we revisit this problem using a data-driven approach satisfying two physical constraints, namely: (a) The displacement of the atomic charges is proportional to the Berry phase polarization; (b) Each water molecule has a formal charge of zero. It turns out that the distribution of molecular dipole moments in liquid water inferred from latent variables is surprisingly similar to that obtained from maximally localized Wannier functions. Apart from putting a maximum-likelihood footnote to the established method, this work highlights the capability of graph convolution based charge models and the importance of physical constraints on improving the model interpretability.}
