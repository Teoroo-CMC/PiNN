# Introduction

PiNN stands for pair-wise interaction neural network, a Python library built on top of TensorFlow for performing atomistic ML tasks. Besides training ML interatomic potentials, PiNN can also predict physical and chemical properties of molecules and materials (e.g. dipole moment and polarizability). It can be used together with the adaptive learn-on-the-fly plugin PiNNAcLe[@shao2024pinnacleadaptivelearnontheflyalgorithm] and the heterogeneous electrode plugin PiNNwall[@PiNNwall] for modelling electrochemical systems.

## Flexibility

![](images/implement.png){width="600"}

PiNN is built with modularized components, and we try to make it as easy as
possible. You do not have to rewrite everything if you just want to design a new
network structure, or apply an existing network to new datasets or new
properties.


## Scalability

PiNN fully adheres to TensorFlow's high-level Estimator and Dataset API. It is
straightforward to train and predict on different computing platforms (CPU,
multiple-GPU, cloud, etc.) without explicit programming.

## Examples

The quickest way to start with PiNN is to follow our example
[notebooks](notebooks/overview.md). The notebooks provide guides to train a
simple ANN potential with a public dataset, import your own data or further
customize the PiNN for your need.

                  increasingly important role in electrification and sustainable
                  development across the globe. A key challenge therein is to
                  understand, control, and design electrochemical energy materials
                  at atomistic precision. This requires inputs from molecular
                  modelling powered by machine learning (ML) techniques. In this
                  work, we have upgraded our pairwise interaction neural network
                  Python package PiNN via introducing equivariant features to the
                  PiNet2 architecture for fitting potential energy surfaces along
                  with PiNet2-dipole for dipole and charge predictions as well as
                  PiNet2-chi for generating atom-condensed charge response kernels.
                  By benchmarking publicly accessible datasets of small molecules,
                  crystalline materials, and liquid electrolytes, we found that the
                  equivariant PiNet2 shows significant improvements over the
                  original PiNet architecture and provides a state-of-the-art
                  overall performance. Furthermore, leveraging on plug-ins such as
                  PiNNAcLe for an adaptive learn-on-the-fly workflow in generating
                  ML potentials and PiNNwall for modelling heterogeneous electrodes
                  under external bias, we expect PiNN to serve as a versatile and
                  high-performing ML-accelerated platform for molecular modelling
                  of electrochemical systems.",
